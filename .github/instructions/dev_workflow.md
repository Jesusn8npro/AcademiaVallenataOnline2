# Development Workflow & Best Practices

This document outlines the development workflow for efficient coding practices and project management.

## Core Development Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add meaningful comments and documentation
- Use TypeScript for type safety

### Project Organization
- Maintain clear file and folder structure
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use meaningful component and function names
- Keep files focused and single-purpose

### Version Control Best Practices
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Review code before merging

## Development Workflow

### Starting a New Feature
1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Plan the implementation approach
3. Break down complex features into smaller tasks
4. Implement following project standards
5. Test thoroughly before committing
6. Create pull request for review

### Code Review Process
- Review for functionality and correctness
- Check for code style and conventions
- Verify proper error handling
- Ensure adequate testing coverage
- Document any architectural decisions

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Perform integration testing
- Validate user experience flows
- Check performance implications

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Minimize bundle size
- Use lazy loading for large components
- Monitor and profile performance

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Keep dependencies updated

### Documentation
- Document API endpoints and parameters
- Maintain README files
- Comment complex business logic
- Update documentation with code changes
- Create user guides when needed

### Collaboration
- Communicate changes to team members
- Use descriptive branch names
- Coordinate database schema changes
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Maintain consistent coding standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Debug systematically using logs
- Isolate problems to specific components
- Check environment configurations
- Verify third-party service integrations
- Review recent changes for regressions

### Problem Resolution
- Document solutions for future reference
- Update error handling based on findings
- Share solutions with team members
- Improve monitoring and alerts
- Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence

## Deployment Process

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- Run all tests and ensure they pass
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify configuration settings
- Review database migrations
- Backup production data

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Perform smoke testing
3. Monitor for errors or issues
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify functionality post-deployment
6. Monitor performance metrics

### Post-deployment
- Monitor application logs
- Check performance metrics
- Verify all features work correctly
- Be prepared for quick rollback if needed
- Document any issues encountered

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
- Use different configurations for different environments
- Document required environment variables
- Validate configuration on startup
- Keep production secrets secure

### Database Management
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Backup before major changes
- Monitor database performance
- Index frequently queried columns
- Clean up unnecessary data regularly

### Third-party Integrations
- Monitor API rate limits
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Have fallback mechanisms
- Keep integration documentation updated

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- Track response times and error rates
- Monitor database query performance
- Check memory and CPU usage
- Set up alerts for critical metrics
- Review logs regularly

### Code Maintenance
- Refactor code when needed
- Update dependencies regularly
- Remove unused code and dependencies
- Improve code based on feedback
- Keep technical debt under control

### User Experience
- Monitor user feedback
- Track user behavior patterns
- Optimize based on usage data
- Improve accessibility
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
